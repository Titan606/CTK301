    <p><a href="#">Why aren't you a General?</a> The headache wouldn't go away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. The monstrous throbbing in her head continued. She had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be happening. They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink.It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life.

He didn't particularly like his drinks cold, but he knew that the drama of chiseling the ice and then pouring a drink over it looked far more impressive than how he actually liked it. It was all about image and he'd managed to perfect the image that he wanted to project.  That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life.
